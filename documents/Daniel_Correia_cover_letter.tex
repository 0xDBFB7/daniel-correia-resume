Dear Recruiting Manager,

In regard to the position of "Project Staff", kindly find my application enclosed. 




\subsubsection*{How my experience compares to the requirements of the position:\\}

\begin{quote}
Wireless communication signal generation and instrument control programming
\end{quote}

Projects I have undertaken have provided moderate experience with RF design and testing, and I have experience with experiment automation and instrument control.

\begin{quote}
Embedded Linux programming knowledge (preferred)
\end{quote}

I have about 7 years' desktop Linux experience, little in the embedded sector.

\begin{quote}
LXI/VISA instrument remote control knowledge (preferred)
\end{quote}

I've used NI-VISA bindings briefly in some projects, though I do not have a good understanding of the underlying protocol.

\begin{quote}
Background in discrete time signal processing (preferred)
\end{quote}

Experience with basic DSP matters - FFT, etc.

\begin{quote}
Wireless communications and radio-channel modelling (optional)
\end{quote}

Basic experience with near/far-field techniques, FDTD simulation. Minimal to no experience with e.g. multipath modelling.\\

%\ntilde 
%
%Clear assets will be strong programming skills in either Python, C++ and/or Fortran, and hands-on experience with object-oriented/modular software design.


Thanks for your time!
