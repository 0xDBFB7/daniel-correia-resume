[SafeSump Inc.]

Founder and CEO of four-year project to design and produce a failure-resistant internet-connected water pump system to reduce ﬂooding in homes.

Obtained $37,500 Ontario Centres of Excellence grant #26828 (2016-2020) and $75,000 Federation of Canadian Municipalities contract (2018-2020) to develop and install systems in 50 homes.

I was responsible for:

- Developing backend data collection API (Python, Linux+Apache stack, PostgreSQL) and frontend UI
- Hardware design for embedded electronic controller (KiCAD and Eagle)
- Conducting presentations and reporting to partners
- Pair programming secure ﬁrmware (10k lines of embedded C on STM32 and SAM4, C++, make, bash),
- Developing data analysis, replication, ﬁltering algorithms (Python, gnuplot)
- Managing production processes, asset tracking, hardware-in-the-loop test systems,
- Series production of custom waterproof capacitive and ultrasonic sensors,
- Version control (Git)

[Technical reports]

A recent project involved:

- A custom 12 GHz microwave spectrometer and automated microﬂuidic sampling system
- Custom FDTD electromagnetic simulation software, now contributed upstream ( https://github.com/flaport/fdtd/pull/27 )
- Documentation in LaTeX, Jupyter notebooks, bibliography management with Zotero and Refbase
- Data visualization with Paraview and Chimera, analysis with Python
- Reviewing some 5,000 pages of scientiﬁc literature spanning 2,300 papers, highlighting 157 cited
- A custom synchronous photon counting ﬂuorescence system, capable of detecting single-digit nanograms of DNA without ampliﬁcation (MAX10 and Cyclone IV FPGAs, Verilog HDL, photomultipliers)
- CNC mill and lathe operation
- Molecular dynamics simulation with GROMACS
- BSL-1 microbiology with E. coli B and T4 bacteriophage culture and plaque assays
- Managing import paperwork, safety, and disposal of chemical reagents
- Negotiating material transfer agreements for datasets
- Symbolic mathematics with Maxima, SymPy, Mathematica, MATLAB
- Falling in love with JuliaLang

[High vacuum systems]

- 0xDBFB7/ionprinter/: A cursory exploration of high-current ion beam lithography techniques.
Led to the following spinoff projects:
- Nyion ( https://github.com/0xDBFB7/Nyion ): a custom GPU-accelerated plasma simulation program using the particle-in-cell method on a custom block-structured mesh data structure for high computational efﬁciency (C++, cmake, OpenGL, gTest, minor HPC with CUDA, OpenCL, OpenMP+4.5 ofﬂoad)
- An inexpensive furnace ( https://0xdbfb7.com/furnace.html ) capable of sintering oxide ceramics: an attempt to make various high-performance ceramic techniques available to a broader audience, built on the work of more than 200 scientiﬁc papers.
- An inexpensive aftermarket controller ( https://github.com/0xDBFB7/varian-turbo-controller ) for the Varian Turbo-V series of turbomolecular pumps
- Control software for an Inﬁcon BPG-400 vacuum gauge

[Kesti Engineering Ltd.]

Occasional board-level repair on Mazak and Haas CNC machines. A successful repair is documented here.
