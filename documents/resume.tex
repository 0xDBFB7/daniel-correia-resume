Dear Recruiting Manager,\\


Hi!\\

Factors which \textbf{decrease} my suitability for the position of \textit{Equipment Technician, Epitaxy}:\\

\begin{itemize} 
	\item No experience with semiconductor process-specific chemistry and safety beyond inert gases
	\item No experience maintaining vacuum cleanliness below 1e-6 mbar.\\
\end{itemize}

Well-suited because:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Hands-on experience fabricating and maintaining high-vacuum equipment (turbo and diff. pumps, ion gauges) and adhering to appropriate standards,
\item A BSc in Science,
\item Experience independently managing and conducting work,
\item Extensive experience with electronics design, prototyping and repair; instrumentation; software development and simulation; and literature review.\\
\end{itemize}

Thanks very much for your time!\\
