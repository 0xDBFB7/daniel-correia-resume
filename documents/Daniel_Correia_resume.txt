[ SafeSump Inc. ]

Co-founder and CTO of a project to design and manufacture a failure-resistant internet-connected water pump system to reduce the incidence of ﬂooding in homes.

Together with a partner company specializing in hydrogeology, we simultaneously collected and analyzed data from the systems in an attempt to better inform municipalities on groundwater ﬂow.

Obtained $37,500 Ontario Centres of Excellence grant #26828 (2016-2020) and fulﬁlled $75,000 Federation of Canadian Municipalities contract (2018-2020) to develop and install systems in 50 homes.

I was responsible for:

- Developing backend data collection API (Python, Linux+Apache stack, PostgreSQL, Git)
- Hardware design and SMD prototyping for embedded electronic controller (KiCAD and Eagle)
- Pair programming secure ﬁrmware and OTA system (embedded C and C++ on STM32 and SAM4, make,
bash)
- Frontend work on a user-facing dashboard to view pump status and modify settings (HTML, JS)
- Conducting presentations and reporting to partners
- Developing data analysis, replication, ﬁltering algorithms (Python, gnuplot)
- Managing production processes, asset tracking, hardware-in-the-loop test systems
- Creating test cells and batch programming systems for custom capacitive and ultrasonic sensors


[ Education ]


B.Sc. in Science from York University. Graduated January 2021.
(Emphasis on electrical engineering, computer science, experimental physics, statistics, chemistry, mathematics, misc)
[ diploma can be verified via: https://learner.mycreds.ca/#/sharelink/b664abe7-53a7-4d64-a0f1-bef16337edd0/57724eeb-34ab-4b79-b2a6-cd6bc311039e ]


[ Projects and skills ]

I believe I have experience contributing to broad, highly interdisciplinary projects with limited guidance.

For example, one recent project involved:

- A custom synchronous photon counting ﬂuorescence system 
( https://github.com/0xDBFB7/fluorescence_photon_counting/releases/download/v0.01/fluorescence.pdf ), 
capable of detecting less than a nanogram of dsDNA without ampliﬁcation (MAX10 and Cyclone IV FPGAs, Verilog HDL)
- Custom FDTD electromagnetic simulation software, now contributed upstream (PyTorch)
- Scientiﬁc programming with JuliaLang, analysis with Python, symbolic mathematics with Maxima, SymPy, Mathematica, MATLAB
- Developing a custom 12 GHz microwave spectrometer and automated microﬂuidic sampling system
- Technical writing, documentation in LaTeX, Jupyter notebooks, bibliography management with Zotero
and Refbase
- CAD/CAM mechanical design and CNC mill and lathe operation
- Molecular dynamics simulation with GROMACS
- Managing import paperwork, safety, and disposal of chemical reagents
- Negotiating material transfer agreements for datasets
- Collaborating and consulting with subject-matter experts

Other representative projects include:

- Nyion ( https://github.com/0xDBFB7/Nyion ): a custom GPU-accelerated plasma simulation program using the particle-in-cell method on a custom block-structured mesh data structure for high computational efﬁciency (C++, cmake, OpenGL, gTest, minor HPC with CUDA, OpenCL, OpenMP+4.5 ofﬂoad)
- An inexpensive furnace capable of sintering oxide ceramics: an attempt to make various high-performance
ceramic techniques available to a broader audience
- An inexpensive aftermarket controller for the Varian Turbo-V series of turbomolecular pumps
- Control software for an Inﬁcon BPG-400 vacuum gauge

[Kesti Engineering Ltd.]

Occasional board-level repair of Mazak and Haas CNC machines. A successful repair is documented here (https://0xdbfb7.com/meldas.html).

[Notable deﬁciencies of experience]

I have completed real-world projects using each of the listed technologies and others not listed, and I am conﬁdent that I can contribute to any of the subjects listed above. 

However, there are also certain large ﬁelds which would require some time expenditure to work efﬁciently.

Some examples of ﬁelds for which more experienced candidates likely exist include advanced physics or mathematics, organic chemistry, the R language, or FORTRAN.

[Other activities]
- 7 years as member of SimCoLab (now BRiX) hackerspace in Barrie, Ontario.
- Part of FIRST Robotics Team 2013 Cybergnomes from 2010 to 2013
- Canadian and German citizenship, native English, broken German
